# Advanced TensorFlow Techniques

Welcome to my repository showcasing advanced techniques in TensorFlow. These notebooks are based on tutorials from the Deep Learning AI Coursera courses. They demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate deep learning models using TensorFlow.

## What's Included

### 1. Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow
- **ResNet.ipynb**: Implementation of the ResNet architecture using custom models and layers.
- **Training_Fashion_MNIST_Using_Custom_Training_Loop.ipynb**: Custom training loop for the Fashion MNIST dataset, showcasing flexibility in training deep learning models.
- **VGGNetwork.ipynb**: Implementation of the VGG network with custom layers and loss functions.

### 2. Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow
- **Breast_Cancer_Prediction_with_Deep_Learning.ipynb**: A deep learning model to predict breast cancer, focusing on custom and distributed training.
- **Distributed_Training_on_the_Oxford_Flowers_102_dataset.ipynb**: Example of distributed training on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset.
- **Horses_or_Humans_Training_with_Graph_Mode_Tensorflow.ipynb**: Training a model to distinguish between horses and humans using TensorFlow's graph mode.

### 3. Mental Health Status Prediction (Personal Project)
- **Files**: `sentiment_mental.ipynb`
- **Description**: This project leverages advanced TensorFlow techniques to train a deep learning model aimed at predicting mental health status. Itâ€™s a personal project that applies and extends the techniques learned in the course.

### 4. Neural Rendering System for Low-Bandwidth Video Calls
- **Files**: `nr/neural_rendering.ipynb`
- **Description**: This notebook demonstrates a neural rendering system designed to address the problem of high bandwidth requirements for video calls. The system uses facial keypoint detection on cropped face images with 68 landmark points to train a deep learning model. This model can encode facial movements as lightweight neural weights, with the intended goal of significantly reducing bandwidth requirements from 5MB/sec to just 5KB/sec.
